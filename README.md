# goProject

I started off writing this app by creating my project in the same folder where i had my GOPATH configured and when i was about to start building my docker container, i realized that i needed go.mod and go.sum files, which in my case that i am not able to create it becase my repo is in the same directory as the GOPATH. I have moved all this file to a new [repo](https://github.com/hailetotaw/slackBot). You can use goProject repo to see my activities while working on this project.
